# Jepsen Java Client

This is a Java wrapper for the Jepsen fault tolerance testing framework which is written in Clojure, a LISP language. LISP's following among programmers nowadays is mediocre, so many developers wish to write a Jepsen test in a more friendly language. This library provides them with such a choice, as it implements a Java wrapper on top of Jepsen, which makes fault injection tests far easier to write.
